OWL-Simple

This package contains a set of modules to parse
an OWL ontology into a hash.

SCRIPTS

The similarity_match.pl compares a list of annotations to 
another ontology and suggests the best match based on a 
similarity metric (n-grams). 

The script expects the first column in the tab delimited input
flat file to contain the values to be matched. Other columns
are preserved in the output.

It is also possible to align one ontology to another and the 
accepted formats are: OWL, OBO, MeSH ASCII.
